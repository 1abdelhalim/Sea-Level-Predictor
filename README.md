# Sea-Level-Predictor

Welcome to the Sea Level Change analysis project! In this project, we will be using a dataset of global average sea level change since 1880 to predict the sea level change through the year 2050.

To get started, you will need to have the following packages installed:

Pandas (for importing and manipulating the data)
Matplotlib (for creating the scatter plots and lines of best fit)
Scipy (for using the linregress function to calculate the slope and y-intercept)
